# POC Price Prediction Project

Attached jupyter notebooks are all regarding the Price Prediction project I implemented as my POC. There are two main code files but the source data is not provided. 

Contents of the Code Files are given below :-

| Code File | Description  | 
| ----  | --------- |
| Price Prediction Data Processing, Modeling, and Evaluation.ipynb    | Text processing, normalization, machine learning and CNN models, and model evaluation|
| EDA - too big to push    | Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, stored in the latest release|

Below implementations can be found in the attached notebook.
